## Data is my playground. I have 3+ years of professional experince as a Data Analyst but Data Analytics and Data Science are my hobby. I have a passion for both telling a story with Data and for helping to identify trends and predict future outcomes with Data.<br>

## I Enjoy sharing what I know with others and learning from those with more experince than myself. <br>

> ## I have experince with Python, SQL, and AWS Cloud Resources. <br> <br>
